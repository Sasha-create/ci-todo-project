 ## Technology used

- **Django framework:**
- Django: This is the main framework used to build the application. Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- Views: Django views handle the logic of your app. You can use both function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views (CBVs).
- Models: Define the database schema for your app. For example, you might have a Task model with fields like title, description, due_date, and completed.
- Forms: Django forms are used to handle user input, such as creating or updating a task.
- URLs: Manage the routing for the application. Django's URL dispatcher maps URLs to views.
- **Database:**
- PostgreSQL: This is the database system used to store all the app data, such as users, tasks, etc.
- Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Interacts with PostgreSQL. Define models in Python, and Django handles the SQL behind the scenes.
- **HTML:**
- For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS:**
- For styling and layout.
- **Javascript:**
- For dynamic content and interactions.
